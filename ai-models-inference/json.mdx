By default, a text generation model responds to your requests with a text in natural language. You can also force the model to respond with JSON instead, which makes it easier to work with outputs programmatically in your application.

For example, you can tell a model the name of an actor or actress and get a response with details of a film they have starred in, in a format like this:

```json
{
  "title": "The Shining",
  "year": 1980,
  "director": "Stanley Kubrick",
  "cast": ["Jack Nicholson", "Shelley Duvall", "Danny Lloyd"],
  "genre": "horror"
}
```

Depending on the settings in your request, the response can be:

- JSON schema. Follows the specific schema you provide `{"type": "json_schema"}` as `response_format`
- JSON object. Forces arbitrary JSON output, the model will decide on the schema by itself `{"type": "json_object"}` as `response_format`
