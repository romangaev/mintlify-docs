By default, a [text generation model](https://docs.nebius.com/studio/inference/models/text-to-text) responds to your requests with a text in natural language. When you send a message to the model using the [Nebius AI Studio API](https://studio.nebius.com/api-reference), you can ask it to respond with JSON instead, which you can pass on to your application.

> For example, you can tell a model the name of an actor or actress and get a response with details of a film they have starred in, in a format like this:
>
> ```
> {
>   "title": "The Shining",
>   "year": 1980,
>   "director": "Stanley Kubrick",
>   "cast": ["Jack Nicholson", "Shelley Duvall", "Danny Lloyd"],
>   "genre": "horror"
> }
> 
> ```

Depending on the settings in your request, the response can be [guided JSON](https://docs.nebius.com/studio/inference/json#structured-output) (JSON that follows your schema) or [unguided JSON](https://docs.nebius.com/studio/inference/json#basic-json) (JSON that isn't guaranteed to follow any schema).
