The **playground** in Nebius AI Studio lets you experiment with available AI models through a web interface — no coding required.

## Model card

In the Nebius AI Studio UI, each **model card** displays key parameters for the model:

- **Input tokens** — Price per token included in an API request, shown in USD per million tokens.
- **Output tokens** — Price per token generated by the model (returned in the API response), in USD per million tokens.
- **Tokens per second** — Approximate generation speed of the model in tokens per second. Actual performance may vary.
- **Quality** — MMLU score reported by the model provider.

To view an extended list of model parameters via the API, send a request to the **List models** endpoint with the query parameter `verbose=true`.

## Using the playground

1. On the **Models** page, find the model you want to try and click **Go to playground** on its card.
2. Under **System prompt**, enter instructions that guide the model’s behavior. You can add **few-shot examples** to demonstrate the desired output format.
3. Start chatting with the model and refine your setup as needed.

Saving your setup:

- **Export as code** — Click **View code** in the left panel to copy your model setup (including the chat) for use in your application. See [**View code**](#) for details.
- **Save as a prompt preset** — Click **Save preset** in the left panel to store your setup for later use or sharing. See [**Prompt presets**](#) for details.

## **Compare setups**

To work with two model setups side by side, click **Compare**. This will open two chat windows where you can submit inputs for both setups at the same time.

You can also synchronize model parameters and system prompts between the two chats. To do this, click **Copy to right** or **Copy to left** in the **Parameters** menu or next to a system prompt.

<Note>
  If the models have different sets of parameter, synchronization may not be possible.
</Note>

To go back to the single-model mode, close one of the chats. The remaining chat will keep its setup and history.

## **View code**

You can copy your model setup and chat as code to continue working with them in your application:

- Single-model mode: Next to **Setup**, click **View code**.
- Compare mode: In a chat window, click → **View code**.
