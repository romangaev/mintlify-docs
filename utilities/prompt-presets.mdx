**Prompt presets** let you save and reuse model setups you’ve tested in Nebius AI Studio, making it easy to manage and share configurations.

In the **Inference playground**, you can store the model parameters, system prompt, and few-shot examples as a prompt preset. Saved presets appear on the **Prompt presets** page, where you can:

- Reopen them in the playground for further testing
- Export them as code for integration into your application
- Share them with your team

### Prompt preset contents

A prompt preset is based on a single model setup from the playground and includes:

- **Text-to-text model** — Other model types are not supported.
- **Model parameters** available in the playground (e.g., temperature, max tokens). Parameters available only via API are not included.
- **System prompt** (if added in your setup).
- **Few-shot examples** — user prompts and AI responses you’ve added.

<Warning>
  Your actual chat history with the model is not saved in the preset.
</Warning>

### Creating a preset

1. In the left panel, click **Save preset**.

   If using Compare mode, click **⋯ → Save preset** in the panel of the desired model.
2. In the dialog, enter a name and (optional) tags.
3. Click **Save preset**.

### Using presets

You can manage all saved presets on the **Prompt presets** page.

1. **Open in playground** — Click a preset to load it back into the playground.
2. **View as code** — Click **⋯ → View code** to generate code for use in your app.
3. **Share** — Click **⋯ → Share** to copy a URL.
