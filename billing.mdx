When you start using <ServiceName/>, you are granted some initial credits. They are sufficient for exploring the service, but you may need to add funds for heavy workloads.

You can top up your balance in two ways:

* Pay with a bank card
* Apply a promo code

Your account balance is displayed in the navigation menu. Make sure the balance is positive; if it is negative, the [API](<UiUrl/>/api-reference) returns errors in response to your requests.

## Paying with a bank card

You can pay with a bank card when you notice that the balance is insufficient, or set up automatic payments.

<ServiceName/> uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to process payments. For more information on accepted card types, see the [Stripe documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards).

### How to add billing information

When you pay for the first time, add your billing information:

1. In the navigation menu, click your balance.
1. Click <Icon icon="circle-plus" iconType="solid" /> **Top up**.
1. Specify the required information:

   * Email address
   * Your name
   * Country of residence or country where your company is registered
   * Billing address

1. Select whether you want to pay as an individual or on behalf of a company.
1. If you select to pay on behalf of a company, specify the company information:

   * Tax ID (VAT number)
   * Company name
   * Postal code

1. Click **Save account details**.

### How to pay with a bank card

To top up your balance by using a bank card, do the following:

1. In the navigation menu, click your balance.
1. Click <Icon icon="circle-plus" iconType="solid" /> **Top up**.
1. If you are paying for the first time, provide your billing information as described above.

<ServiceName/> saves the card used for the first payment and will use it for future payments.

### How to configure automatic top-ups

1. In the navigation menu, click your balance.

1. Click **Setup auto top-up**.
1. Enable the automatic top-up option and specify its settings:

   * Amount to add.
   * Card details, if not provided already.

1. Click **Save auto top-up settings**.

### How to change the card

To update your payment card, do the following:

1. In the navigation menu, click your balance.
1. Go to [Billing details](<UiUrl/>/billing/details).
1. In the **Payment details** section, next to your current card, <Icon icon="pencil" iconType="solid" /> â†’ **Edit**.
1. Enter the details of the new card.

If you enabled automatic top-ups, your new card will be used for them as well.

### How taxes are calculated

## Applying a promo code

You can apply a promo code even if you have not added billing information or a bank card.

To apply a promo code if billing is not configured, do the following:

1. In the navigation menu, click your balance.
1. Click <Icon icon="circle-plus" iconType="solid" /> **Top up**.

1. Click <Icon icon="circle-plus" iconType="solid" /> **Top up**.
1. Select **With promo code**.
1. Enter your promo code and click **Top up**.

Once your promo code is applied, your balance increases by the corresponding amount.

To verify that the promo code is applied, check the [Payments](<UiUrl/>/billing) section.
