You can use a [Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/nebius-ai-studio/nebius-ai-studio/collection) to work with Nebius AI Studio. This collection allows you to do the following:

- Test the Nebius AI Studio API in a ready Postman collection
- Explore abilities of Nebius AI Studio and find useful features for your application
- Debug the code by using Postman

The collection includes pre-configured requests and scripts to simplify integration and testing.

## **Install Postman**

1. [Sign in](https://identity.getpostman.com/login) to Postman or create a new account. You can use your Google account or SSO.
2. [Download](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and install the Postman desktop application.

   You can only work with the Nebius AI Studio collection from the desktop application.

## **Set up the collection**

1. Fork the Postman collection by Nebius AI Studio to your workspace. To do this, select **Nebius AI Studio API** in the sidebar and then select **Fork** in the upper right. The collection copy is created where you can add variables and customize requests.

   You can create a fork only if [your profile is public](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/#create-a-fork).
2. [Create an API key](https://docs.nebius.com/studio/api/authentication) for authentication.
3. To store the key in the Postman vault, create a variable with the key. To do this, select the collection in the sidebar and then go to the **Authorization** tab. Next, click on the `{{vault:nebius-api-key}}` variable. Postman prompts you to paste the key and create a vault.

## **Send a request**

Open the fork in the Postman application and select an endpoint to be tested.

To send a request:

1. Create and set the necessary variables. The variables, including the model name, settings and context, are enclosed in curly brackets `{{` `}}`.
   - To set variables for a particular request, open its body and hover over the variables in it. For example, image-to-text generation requires a `model_vision` variable with a name of a [vision model](https://docs.nebius.com/studio/inference/models/vision).
   - To set variables for all requests in the collection, select the collection in the sidebar and then go to the **Variables** tab. On this tab, you can also add new variables.
2. Finish a pre-request script if it is included in the required method of the collection. On the page of the required endpoint, go to the **Scripts** tab. If there is a pre-request script that fills in the context or settings for the model, update the script with your content.

<Accordion title="Example for text-to-text generation">
  The pre-request script creates a `messages` variable with chat contents and then assigns it to the `messages` collection variable:

  ```
  let messages = [
     {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Answer succinctly and to the point and always add 'haha ' after each word you print out."
     },
     {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Which team won the UEFA Champions League in 2019?"
     },
     {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Liverpool haha FC haha"
     },
     {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Who scored in the final?"
     }
  ];
  
  pm.collectionVariables.set('messages', JSON.stringify(messages));
  ```

  Replace the system prompt, user's and assistant's messages with your own chat messages. Add more messages if needed, but make sure that the last message is from the `user`.
