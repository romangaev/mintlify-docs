To authenticate, include your _API key_ (e.g., `ABC123...`) in the `Authorization` header, as shown below:

```
Authorization: Bearer ABC123...
```

<Warning>
  Keep your keys private; do not share or expose them in client-side code. If a key is compromised, Nebius AI Studio can automatically revoke it
</Warning>

To get an API key:

1. In Nebius AI Studio, go to the  [API keys](https://studio.nebius.com/settings/api-keys) section.
2. Click  **Create API key**.
3. Enter the key name and then click **Create**.
4. Save the displayed API key. You cannot open it later in Nebius AI Studio.

<Tip>
  In the [Nebius AI Studio inference playground](https://studio.nebius.com/playground), you can view your model setup and chat as code that makes API requests, and use this code in your applications. For more details, see [View code](https://docs.nebius.com/studio/inference/playground#view-code).

<Tip>
  You can use [integrations with third-party instruments](https://docs.nebius.com/studio/inference/integrations) instead of the API.
