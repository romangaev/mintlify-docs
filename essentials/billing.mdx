import { serviceName, uiUrl } from '/snippets/variables.mdx';

When you start using serviceName, you are granted some initial credits. They are sufficient for exploring the service, but you may need to add funds for heavy workloads.

You can top up your balance in two ways:

- [Pay with a bank card](https://docs.nebius.com/studio/billing#card)
- [Apply a promo code](https://docs.nebius.com/studio/billing#promo-code)

Your account balance is displayed in the navigation menu. Make sure the balance is positive; if it is negative, the [API]({uiUrl}/api-reference) returns errors in response to your requests.

## Paying with a bank card

You can pay with a bank card when you notice that the balance is insufficient, or set up automatic payments.

serviceName uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to process payments. For more information on accepted card types, see the [Stripe documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards).
