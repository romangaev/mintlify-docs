description: "You can fine-tune a generic model to adjust it to domain-specific tasks. By using fine-tuning in Nebius AI Studio, you can also save costs on training a model: using datasets costs cheaper than using numerous prompts."

## **Prerequisites**

1. Choose one of the [models](https://docs.nebius.com/studio/fine-tuning/models) supported for [fine-tuning](https://docs.nebius.com/studio/fine-tuning).
2. Create a [dataset](https://docs.nebius.com/studio/fine-tuning/datasets) for training.

   You can optionally create an additional dataset for validation. Split the data between two datasets as 80–90% for training and 10–20% for validation. Requirements for validation datasets are the same as for training datasets.
3. [Create an API key](https://docs.nebius.com/studio/api/authentication) for authentication.
4. Save the API key to an environment variable: 

   ```
   export NEBIUS_API_KEY=<API_key>
   ```

## **How to fine-tune a model**

1. Using Python : Install openai package:

   ```python
   pip3 install openai
   ```
2. Import essential librarires

   ```python
   import os
   from openai import OpenAI
   import time
   ```
3. Set up Nebius API key

   ```python
   client = OpenAI(
       base_url="https://api.studio.nebius.com/v1/",
       api_key=os.environ.get("NEBIUS_API_KEY"),
   )
   ```
4. Uploads a training and a validation dataset. The validation dataset is optional.

   ```
   # Upload a training dataset
   training_dataset = client.files.create(
       file=open("<dataset_name>.jsonl", "rb"), # Specify the dataset name
       purpose="fine-tune"
   )
   
   # Upload a validation dataset
   validation_dataset = client.files.create(
       file=open("<dataset_name>.jsonl", "rb"), # Specify the dataset name
       purpose="fine-tune"
   )
   ```
5. Configure Fine-tuning parameters.

   For more information about the tuning job parameters, see the specification of the [fine-tuning job object](https://docs.nebius.com/studio/fine-tuning/how-to-fine-tune#job-specs).

   ```python
   # Fine-tuning job parameters
   job_request = {
       "model": "<...>",
       "training_file": "training_dataset.id",
       "validation_file": "validation_dataset.id",
       "hyperparameters": {
           "batch_size": "<...>",
           "learning_rate_multiplier": "<...>",
           "n_epochs": "<...>",
           "warmup_ratio": "<...>",
           "weight_decay": "<...>",
           "lora": "<True|False>",
           "lora_r": "<...>",
           "lora_alpha": "<...>",
           "lora_dropout": "<...>",
           "packing": "<True|False>",
           "max_grad_norm": "<...>",
       },
       "integrations": [{
               "type": "wandb",
               "wandb": {
                   "api_key": "<...>",
                   "project": "<...>"
               }
       }]
   }
   ```
6. Create and run the finetuning job

   ```python
   # Create and run the fine-tuning job
   job = client.fine_tuning.jobs.create(**job_request)
   ```


1. Checks that the job status is `succeeded`.

   The status of a freshly started job is `running`. The script polls the status periodically to make sure that the job status has changed to `succeeded`. The minimum time window between subsequent polls is 15 seconds.

   If the status is `failed`, examine the output. It describes the error and how to fix it. If the error code is `500`, resubmit the job.
2. Checks that the training has been successful. To do this, check the job events. They are created when the job status changes.

   You can consider the training as finished if the response contains either the `Dataset processed successfully` or `Training completed successfully` message.
3. Retrieves the contents of the files with the fine-tuned model.

   You get the files for every fine-tuning checkpoint. A checkpoint is created after every epoch of training a model, so you get intermediate results of the training. If you need final results, use the files from the last checkpoint.
4. Saves the contents to files. The script creates a directory per checkpoint and saves the files into these directories.

Now, you can use these files to [host the fine-tuned model](https://docs.nebius.com/studio/fine-tuning/host-model) and work with it.
