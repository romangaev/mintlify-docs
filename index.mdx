## Setting up

You can test, compare and deploy large language models (LLMs) in your applications. Nebius AI Studio offers a playground for experimenting with models and an OpenAI-compatible API for inference and fine-tuning.

Additionally, Nebius AI Studio is integrated with various third-party services, such as LlamaIndex.

If you need to train a model and tailor it to domain-specific tasks, use fine-tuning in Nebius AI Studio.
